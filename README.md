# SMTI Teacher-Course Management
 The SMTI Teacher-Course Management website is written in ASP.Net Web application using Visual Studio 2022/2019 and C#. It enables the program coordinator to allocate courses to teachers after successful login. Multiple teachers can be assigned to each course and a teacher can be assigned more than one course, but the number of courses assigned to a teacher must not exceed 3. The program coordinator can view a list of all courses assigned to a teacher and all teachers assigned to a course. The teacher can view the courses assigned to him/her after successful login. The application stores employee, course, and user information.
