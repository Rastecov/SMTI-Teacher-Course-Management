# SMTI Teacher-Course Management
 The SMTI Teacher-Course Management website is written in ASP.NET Core framework, in conjunction with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript and Microsoft SQL Server. It enables the program coordinator to allocate courses to teachers after successful login. Multiple teachers can be assigned to each course and a teacher can be assigned more than one course, but the number of courses assigned to a teacher must not exceed 3. The program coordinator can view a list of all courses assigned to a teacher and all teachers assigned to a course. The teacher can view the courses assigned to him/her after successful login. The application stores employee, course, and user information.
